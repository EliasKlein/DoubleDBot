# The DoubleDBot (not really short for DRACOON Discord Bot)

A Bot made over a few days for the unofficial DRACOON Discord Server.
And it is my first project I'm actually setting to public.\
I made it because I wanted to try it out and I didn't want to use some third party bots.
(If YOU are reading this: No, I will not add Carl-Bot. 
Instead, this Bot will now run on your raspberry pi and hopefully not fry it.)\
If you want to use it feel free.
I really don't see the reason why you would want to do so or what is so special about this Bot. It really can't do much.

## Features

- Self assign roles via reaction (like basically every Bot)
- A new member *experience*
- "Relatively" configurable via property files (within the boundaries planned for the server)
- (optional) Encryption for all properties
  - This is probably very unnecessary but this is a DRACOON Bot.

## Good to know stuff

- When using you'll need to add the Discord Bot security token, the encryption password and salt as environment
variables.
  - The key for the variables can be found and changed in the config.properties.
- Theoretically, you can add as many/few games in the context.properties as you like. Just make sure to count the number
up properly.
- For the encryption stuff
  - If you want to encrypt any value of the context.properties, add "ENC-" at the start and let the Encryptor do its
  job. All encrypted properties will be in the output.properties from which you can copy them into the
  context.properties. (Writing directly into the context.properties would just butcher any formatting)
  - I was a little inspired by the Jasypt's EncryptableProperties while adding this, which I didn't use as they are not
  part of the light version. This is probably a little hacky, but hey, it just works.
  - Also, I used the pooled encryptor. By default, it only uses a Pool of 1,
  but if you want to bump it up for the placebo speed increase you can do so in the config.properties.

I don't take feature requests.

Is anyone actually reading this?
